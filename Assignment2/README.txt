Contacts class works able to read through the list to find a contact and able to read contacts from a file and throw errors when number is missing or lines are missing will still work if newlines are added and only non-important information is missing (using eclipse the file would only read from a folder above, and to change filename is entered in the importContacts method in appointmentFrame).  
Error handling added for all input fields that can go out of range, catch EmptyStackException and Null Pointer exceptions and others where appropriate. Error messages appear in description box and clear button for description box to clear error messages.
