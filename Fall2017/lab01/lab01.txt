Lab01
-----

1. Look at the Sum of Squares example(s) in your textbook (starting at end of page 64).
   Understand the pseudo-code and programs.
   
2. Copy the following files to your own space, and look at the code:
   
   SumSquares.c     -- the code from Program 3.4 of the text, which I copied from
                       /usr/courses/cps305/standish.source.code/Ch3programs.txt
   SumSquares.h     -- an include file for any program wishing to call the SumSquares function
   SumSquaresTest.c -- a main program to call SumSquares with a variety of input
   
3. Compile the code into an executable and run the program to check it works.  
   If you forgot to compile, see below.

4. Some tests in SumSquaresTest.c are there to test the base case. Identify these tests.

5. Modify the driver program (SumSquaresTest.c) to try other input. Run and check it works.
   Try testing it for extremely large input, and invalid input, and see what happens.

6. If you finish the above, write functions to do Sum of Squares using different
   approaches to recursion. Check your functions work.

   GOING-UP:           SumSquaresGU.c 
   EDGES-AND-CENTER:   SumSquaresEC.c 
   DIVISION-IN-HALVES: SumSquaresDH.c

   COMPILE (separately):
      gcc -c SumSquares.c
      gcc -c SumSquaresTest.c
   
   LINK the object code into an executable called SumSquaresTest:
      gcc -o SumSquaresTest SumSquaresTest.o SumSquares.o
   
   RUN the executable:
      ./SumSquaresTest
   
   
   Note: you could have compiled, created executable, and run it by: 
   
      gcc SumSquaresTest.c SumSquares.c
      ./a.out
    or
      gcc -o SumSquaresTest SumSquaresTest.c SumSquares.c
      ./SumSquaresTest
