Lab 04 
-------

SEE THE README FILE FIRST.

Directory code_from_text/ contains the following files from Section 7.8 of your text:

   QueueImplementation.c
   QueueTypes.h
   QueueInterface.h

Minor changes were made to these files, such as:
   -definition of SystemError function
   -return values for Insert and Remove
   -the Queue holds integer items

A simple driver program is in file:  SimpleQueueDriver.c
Use separate compilation to create QueueImplementation.o and SimpleQueueDriver.o
Compile the *.o files into an executable called SimpleQueueDriver
Execute your SimpleQueueDriver to make sure it works!

Create a driver program named QueueDriver.c to more thoroughly test the Queue 
implementation.  (Do not alter the given Queue*.[ch] files. You must get your 
driver to use the Q implementation via appropriate #include line(s) and compilation).
Your driver should: 


   a) create and initialize an empty Q.
       i) check that the Q is empty (using function Empty )
   b) try removing an integer from the empty Q
       i) check Remove returns correct code (failure)
      ii) check that the Q is still empty (using function Empty)
   c) insert integers 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 onto the Q USING A LOOP, each time
       i) check Insert returns correct code (success)
   d) remove ALL integers from the Q one at a time USING A LOOP, each time
       i) check Remove returns correct (success) code
      ii) check the correct integer is "removed" by Remove
   e) check the Q is empty (function Empty)
   f) If all tests are successful, QueueDriver prints "Tests Successful"
   g) If any tests failed, QueueDriver prints "Some Tests Failed"


Use separate compilation to create QueueImplementation.o and QueueDriver.o
Compile Queue*.o into an executable called QueueDriver
Execute your QueueDriver to make sure it works!
