1. Consider the tree in file XXXX

   a. Give a Level Order Traversal of the tree.
   b. Give a Pre-Order Traversal of the tree.
   c. Give a In-Order Traversal of the tree.
   d. Give a Post-Order Traversal of the tree.

2. Consider the expression tree in file YYYY:
   What is the final result of evaluating the expression denoted by this tree?
   (Give the final integer value).
                                                                 
3. Consider the BST in file XXXX:
   Insert 18 into the tree. 
   What node is 18's parent? is 18 the right- or left-child of its parent?

4. Consider the BST in file XXXX:
   Insert 21 into the ORIGINAL tree. 
   What node is 21's parent? is 21 the right- or left-child of its parent?

5. Consider the BST in file XXXX:
   If your tree has a 19 in it:
   If 19 were deleted from the ORIGINAL tree, what is 17's new right-child?
   If your tree has a 20 in it:
   If 20 were deleted from the ORIGINAL tree, what is the new root?

6. Consider the BST in file XXXX:
   If your tree has a 17 in it:
   If 17 were deleted from the ORIGINAL tree, what are the 2 candidate nodes to replace it?
   If your tree has a 20 in it:
   If 8 were deleted from the ORIGINAL tree, what are the 2 candidate nodes to replace it?

7. There are additional questions for AVL trees in AVLquestions.txt and solutions in usual place.
