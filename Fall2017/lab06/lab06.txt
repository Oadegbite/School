Understand B-trees from class, including insertion and deletion.

In the B-tree below, to indicate X and Y are IN THE SAME NODE, 
we use notation:
        X-Y or X--Y or X---Y etc.



                     I---N
                   /   |    \
                  /    |     \
                 /     |      \
                /      |       \
               /       |        \
              /        |         \
            D          K           Q
           / \        / \         / \
          /   \      /   \       /   \
        A-B   E-G   J     M     P   S--T


A LEVEL-ORDER traversal of the above B-tree is:
I.N.D.K.Q.A.B.E.G.J.M.P.S.T

Q0: 
    Do a level-order traversal of the tree at the bottom of page:
    http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~dwoit/courses/cps305/coursedirPublic305/NOTES/trees/T17.gif
    Use a dot between keys, as above.

TRY THE TRAVERSAL FIRST, then... 
Check your solutionis : 
     10.20.5.7.15.30.57.2.6.8.9.11.17.25.29.40.59



For all remaining questions:
  -Once the insertion/deletion is complete, do a level-order traversal 
   of the resulting tree, putting a dot between keys like above.

Q1:
  Do an level-order traversal of the 2-3 tree (B-Tree order 3) in:
  http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~dwoit/courses/cps305/coursedirPublic305/NOTES/trees/BTree1.jpg

  TRY THE TRAVERSAL FIRST,  then... 
  Check your solutionis : 
    50.30.41.70.90.10.20.34.37.47.60.80.97.100

Q2:
  Insert 95 into the 2-3 tree (B-Tree order 3) in:
  http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~dwoit/courses/cps305/coursedirPublic305/NOTES/trees/BTree1.jpg
  Use "rotation with sibling" WHEN POSSIBLE; otherwise use node splitting (push up to parent). 
  THEN, insert 93 into the resulting B-tree.
  Use "rotation with sibling" WHEN POSSIBLE; otherwise use node splitting (push up to parent). 


Q3: 
  Delete 70 from the ORIGINAL 2-3 tree (B-Tree order 3) in:
  http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~dwoit/courses/cps305/coursedirPublic305/NOTES/trees/BTree1.jpg
  Do the deletion using the method described in class--but you must use the inorder PREDECESSOR
  as the replacement key. (see below for more on inorder predecessor).

Q4: 
  Delete 70 from the ORIGINAL 2-3 tree (B-Tree order 3) in:
  http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~dwoit/courses/cps305/coursedirPublic305/NOTES/trees/BTree1.jpg
  Do the deletion using the method described in class--but you must use the inorder SUCCESSOR
  as the replacement key. (see below for more on inorder successor).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INORDER PREDECESSOR/SUCCESSOR:
As discussed in class...
One way to find the inorder predecessor/successor of key X:
  -Print all the keys of the tree in order (sorted). i.e., do an inorder traversal. 
  -X's inorder predecessor is the key that is printed JUST BEFORE X.
  -X's inorder successor   is the key that is printed JUST AFTER X.
